# ACE

## Introduction

Welcome to ACE (Artificial Consciousness Engine), which is a digital assistant designed to help you with your daily tasks and provide you with answers to a variety of questions. ACE is designed to be easy to use, privacy-focused, and open-source, so you can customise it to suit your needs.

## Installation

ACE is built in Python Version 3.10, and uses the [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager to manage dependencies.

First, ensure you have Python 3.10 installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Next, install the `uv` package manager by running the following command:

```bash
pip install uv
```

Finally, install the dependencies for ACE by running the following command:

```bash
uv install
```

## Usage

To start ACE, run the following command:

```bash
uv run main.py
```

This will start the ACE digital assistant, and you can interact with it by typing in commands and questions in a natural language format.
